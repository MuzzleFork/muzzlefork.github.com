    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This blog tends to get updated... sporadically. I get the energy to post more often and that generally results in transferring the content from one blog engine to another - sometimes the new blog doesn't even get a new post. This time, I'm changing from wordpress to octopress, living in GitHub pages and I guess, once again, I'll pledge to post more often.</p>

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<ul>
<li>I can hack away on posts in <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 2</a> and deploy them whenever I'm ready.</li>
<li>I can write my posts in markdown which is great.</li>
<li>I found a great <a href="https://github.com/blueplanet/sublime-text-2-octopress">octopress plugin for sublime</a> which is really handy and to which I've been able to contribute some changes and features to.</li>
<li>Octopress and Jekyll are in ruby, ST2 plugins are in python and the existing templates use LESS. A nice change to my day-to-day life as a PHP developer to hack around in some new technologies.</li>
<li>Performance of effectively static media via GitHub pages is much better than loading pages through wordpress' database driven structure. See if you can tell when I changed the hosting arrangement in the graph below.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Detractors</h2>

<ul>
<li>I actually really liked wordpress' stats available through JetPack. I've set up Google Analytics, but while it's probably a better product, it's just not as friendly.</li>
<li>Wordpress has so many themes available. This is possibly a benefit though - I used to get <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis">analysis paralysis</a> in attempting to decide which one to use.</li>
</ul>


<p>Let's see how I go. Hereby pledging (once again) to post more often, keeping it technical.</p>
