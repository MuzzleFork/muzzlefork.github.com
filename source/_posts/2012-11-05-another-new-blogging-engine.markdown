This blog tends to get updated... sporadically. I get the energy to post more often and that generally results in transferring the content from one blog engine to another - sometimes the new blog doesn't even get a new post. This time, I'm changing from wordpress to octopress, living in GitHub pages and I guess, once again, I'll pledge to post more often.

## Benefits

* I can hack away on posts in [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and deploy them whenever I'm ready.
* I can write my posts in markdown which is great.
* I found a great [octopress plugin for sublime](https://github.com/blueplanet/sublime-text-2-octopress) which is really handy and to which I've been able to contribute some changes and features to.
* Octopress and Jekyll are in ruby, ST2 plugins are in python and the existing templates use LESS. A nice change to my day-to-day life as a PHP developer to hack around in some new technologies.
* Performance of effectively static media via GitHub pages is much better than loading pages through wordpress' database driven structure. See if you can tell when I changed the hosting arrangement in the graph below.

## Detractors
* I actually really liked wordpress' stats available through JetPack. I've set up Google Analytics, but while it's probably a better product, it's just not as friendly.
* Wordpress has so many themes available. This is possibly a benefit though - I used to get [analysis paralysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis) in attempting to decide which one to use.

Let's see how I go. Hereby pledging (once again) to post more often, keeping it technical.
